# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, we encourage you to report it responsibly. Since there is no direct contact available, please consider taking the following steps:

1. **Check for Existing Issues**  
   Before reporting a new vulnerability, please review the project's [Issues](../../issues) to see if it has already been reported.

2. **Responsible Disclosure**  
   If the vulnerability is not publicly disclosed yet, consider submitting it privately via GitHub's [Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories) feature. This allows maintainers to review and address the issue before it becomes public.

3. **Follow GitHub's Security Best Practices**  
   Refer to GitHub's [Coordinated Disclosure Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/github-security-policy) to ensure that vulnerabilities are handled appropriately.

## Security Best Practices

To help keep this project secure, we follow these security principles:

- **Use Dependencies Responsibly**  
  We strive to keep dependencies up to date and monitor them for vulnerabilities.
  
- **Minimize Sensitive Data Exposure**  
  The project does not store or process sensitive data directly. Users should avoid committing secrets, API keys, or credentials.
  
- **Encourage Secure Contributions**  
  Contributions must adhere to security best practices, such as input validation, proper authentication, and secure coding guidelines.

## No Formal Support

This project does not provide direct security support. If you have general security concerns, please follow best practices outlined above. 

For further guidance on reporting security issues in open-source projects, you can refer to [OpenSSF's Vulnerability Disclosure Guidelines](https://openssf.org/vulnerability-disclosure/).
